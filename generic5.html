							"> I've been struggling to come up with a project idea but I think this one is pretty neat. 
</p>
		<p style="
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
"> I personally suffer from allergies which result in a range of symptoms from sneezing and 
			runny nose to rashes and the characteristic mozzie bite like lumps that 
			pop up on my skin after contact with an allergen. 
In fact, large parts of the population have some form of allergy that affects day to day quality of life
			with a survey of US citizens showing almost 50% suffer from some form of allergy. 
Another portion of the population use birth control implants as contraception. 
			These are long-term rods imbedded in the body that can be effective for years. <br>
The combined idea is a subdermal or internal small device that can be implanted and release 
			antihistamines on detection of elevated levels of histamine or be used for
			scheduled release of specific allergens for long term allergen immunotherapy. 
			This would probably require a small functioning unit that can detect stimuli and 
			periodically release a signal like a micro:bit or microprocessor. It would be a step 
			forward in increasing QoL of allergy sufferers and could even be extended to deliver other medications.<br>
			This is an interesting project for me as it combines both IT knowledge and science. </p>

<p style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; ">

The aim behind this idea is to create a device that can be surgically 
	implanted into the body and be able to help alleviate or treat a 
	person’s allergies over a long period of time (years). If people 
	are willing to get a rod implanted for contraceptive, an allergy 
	implant that means no more antihistamine pills or removing allergies 
	would be equally desirable and have a large market. 
<br>
This would be a subdermal or perhaps non-invasive 
	internal implant. Implant location would be in
	muscle or fat near a main artery to increase speed of delivery.
	It will be flexible and hopefully minimal in size.
	<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-implantable-micro-machine-can-deliver-medications-from-inside-the-body" class="title"><b>A micro machine</b></a> has already been developed and trialled to test this idea of periodical release of substances via an internal mechanism. 
	Researchers utilised it to periodically release chemotherapy medication - doxorubicin –
	in mice with induced osteosarcoma. The results were promising, and this
	mechanism does not require any external signals, functioning only through
	a rotating magnet. If we can combine this form of periodical medication 
	release with an implantable mini processing unit of some sort to receive and 
	send signals, we can set a changeable schedule for when medication will be released. </p>

<p style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; ">
There are several hurdles to this idea, barring those of the ethical type. 
	A main issue is how we would be able to power this machine. 
	One idea is to use the kinetic energy or pressure from motion
	of the body itself to generate energy to power the machine. 
	Kinetic energy can be used to power a wristwatch through movement
	of a weighted magnetic half, a similar mechanism can be used to
	power something internally.</p>
	
<p style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; ">
How to schedule release would also be an issue. 
	The ideal would be to use a microprocessor and the same 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_drive" class="title"><b>Geneva drive</b></a> mechanism used by the researchers to both release
	the medication and schedule the release. Each revolution can be 
	counted through the microprocessor and at a set number of revolutions, 
	we can signal to trigger a rotation on a second Geneva drive which would
	release the medication and ideally reset the count. This would allow for regular 
	intervals for dosage and to change interval spacing we could pre-set the microprocessor 
	to trigger at different number of rotations e.g 10, 10, 20, 40, 40, 40. This might
	require some programming on what stimuli is considered input and to store and count rotations. </p>
							
<p style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; ">
What happens if it runs out? This is another hurdle that would require
	knowledge of how much dosage is required as medication. If we are able 
	to develop a more potent version for the same medication to reduce amount,
	this would also end up affecting the resulting size of the implant and lifespan
	of the implant. Whether or not the medication can be absorbed through tissue as
	opposed to oral ingestion or inhalation is another factor to consider. <br>
Another issue is the type of material to use – as this is imbedded in the body, the material
	has to be safe yet also have a certain degree of flexibility to match the body’s movements.
	<a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel#Hydrogels” class=”title”><b> Hydrogels</b></a> are a
	solid choice due to its high water content allowing for flexibility. Silicon is also 
	a potentially viable option due to its existing internal usage, non-toxicity and compatibility with electronics. </p>

<p style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; ">
To successfully implement this as a project would require skills in 
	a few different areas. We would need to program and create a
	microprocessor to respond to the stimuli, work out the optimal
	design of the Geneva drives and also take into account size restriction
	and material compatibility. As the procession unit need only receive, store, 
	count and send a signal, perhaps a basic micro:bit type unit with python
	programming may work. Research and trials would also need to be done on what 
	materials to use. Given technological advances, size of the microprocessor
	should be small enough to be implantable but may be costly to produce. 
	Feasibility of the project relies on being able to source the material
	(hydrogel, microprocessor) and also through success of trials. </p>

<p style=" font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; ">
If the project is successful, then we may be able to see 
	implantable, long-term medication delivery systems.
	Current allergen desensitisation therapy involves regular 
	visits to the doctor. This implant can be used to set an
	allergen delivery schedule for long term allergy immunotherapy 
	that allows users to freely go about their day-to-day lives without 
	having to continually visit the doctor for the shot. If we alter it, 
	we could even set it to release antihistamines on detection of increased 
	histamine levels in the blood, meaning users won’t have to keep taking allergy
	pills for hay fever or cats. We can increase the quality of life for all allergy sufferers with this implant.
